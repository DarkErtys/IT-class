VIM editor can be run from terminal (also for example via SSH) without GUI (or with GUI as GVim).
VIM is improved version of VI, but ones one get familiar with VIM, he should have no problem to handle VI, which is installed on almost every UNIX-like system. 
As VIM is more advanced than VI (it was made later, as clone of VI; by the way even VI used on Linux is clone of original VI created as part of UNIX as closed-source program).
VI works in couple models for example Insertion mode, edition mode.
To start the editor one have to type its name in terminal eg. vim [optional - name of file to edit].
It is possible to move around the text using keys "h" "k" "l" and ";"
To enter insertion mode one have to press 'i', 'a' or any other command witch is used to inert text.
Key "x" is used to remove single char.
Combination "d[number of repetitions][direction of move]" eg. "d5j" -  is also used to delete text, "dd" for delete line.
To enter edition mode one need to press ESC key.
To save file one need to insert in edition mode combination ":w [filename]"; to edit other file ":e [path to file]"
Key "v" is used to start visual mode mode.
Key "y" is used to yank (copy) text, "p" to paste. "p" could be used also to paste deleted text. '"+y' to copy to X system's clipboard; '"+p' to paste form clipboard.
":bdelete" is used to delete current buffer, ":new" to open new window with an empty buffer.
"/[expression]" to search, ":s/[searched expression]/[substitution]/" to substitute. 
To quit the window - ":q", to save and close - "wq", to force closing (even with modified buffer) - ":q!"
All commands stared with colon should be insert in edition mode.
